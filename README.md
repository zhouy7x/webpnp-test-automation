This is a test automation framework based on [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), supports key Web workloads automation testing on Chrome browser across multiple platforms, as well as automatically generating test result and sending test report via mail.

## Support

- Platforms: Windows, Linux
- Workloads: Speedometer2, WebXPRT3, Unity3D, JetStream2

## Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), recommend to use Node.js LTS, current this tool is based on Node.js (12.17.0 LTS).

## Workflow
The automation test mainly takes the following actions:
* Get the system information like CPU, Memory, OS.
* Launch the Chrome browser and read the GPU information and browser version.
* Launch the chrome and run each workload defined in config.json for several times. The test results of all arounds are recorded.
* Choose the middle value among the test arounds and store the device information and all the results of this workload test
  to `./results/{platform}/{workload}` directory(If it does not exists, create it). The files are named as `{data}_{CPU}_{Browser}.json`.
* Before storing the test results to json files, upload this test results to remote server for backup.
* Test report delivery is hosted on remote server, which will do following actions:
  1. Check if there are avaliable completed report for one round of regular tesitng every 6 hours, if yes, start generating test report.
  1. Generate excel files to list the scores between CPUs for the same workload at `./excels` directory(If it does not exists, create it) and then upload them to the Web PnP Report site database.
  1. Download the trend charts for each workload and put them on the `./charts` directory(If it does not exists, create it).
  1. Generate html report that contains the comparison tables based on the json files. The trend charts will be inserted into the html.
  1. Send E-mail to involved teams of the project. If there're any errors occured, send the errors information to dev team.
  1. Backup test results and generated html report.

## Usage
- Go to this folder
- ```javascript
  npm install
  ```
- Config test plan via config.json:
  1. Set test target in `workloads` fields, pls. don't edit the workload name while you can change the workload's url and running times via `url` and `run_times` fields respectively. You can also remove some of these workloads to in order to run single workload testing.
  1. To support both Windows and Linux platforms, `win_chrome_path` and `linux_chrome_path` are introduced.
  1. `chrome_flags` is used for setting specific chrome flag.
  1. This tool allows to run tests automatically in a pre-set scheduler by using [node-corn](https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron), you can set the test cadence via `test_cadence` field. Please refer to [cron syntax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron#cron-syntax) to check how to set a test cadence.
  1. `mail_test_report` field is used for setting stakeholders' mail list who'd like to receive the test report.
  1. `mail_dev_notice` field is used for setting mail list who'd like to receive the error message when the testing goes into something wrong or receive test report when `dev_mode` is `true`.
  1. On Linux platform, please set the `chrome_linux_password` field the Linux sudo password. It's required while upgrading the chrome as install Linux package might need sudo permission.
  1. `dev_mode` represents develop mode, setting it to `true` will skip generating and uploading excel file, skip test results upload.
  1. If you don't want to run the test at a specific schedule, you can simply set `enable_cron` to `false`.
  1. Set `password` item in `result_server` field for connecting to result server if you are going to run regular testing.
  1. `chromium_builder` field is used for running test automation with specific chromium build from build server. Currently only support for Windows platform. The build server will automatically build chromium at the head of commit id passed by user, then upload chromium build to http://powerbuilder.sh.intel.com/project/chromium_builder/, and then this tool get the corresponding chromium build to run testing at target device. Once you set `enable_chromium_build` to `true`, you must set the `commit_id` to the specific commit id for building chromium, usually you only need to pass the first 7 characters of a normal chromium commit id. The build server's host and port are set in `host` and `port` fields by default. Note: with `enable_chromium_build` set to `true`, the tool will automatically udpate the `dev_mode` to `true`.

- Run the test: restart the PC and go to this folder again and run:
  `node main.js`
- Add a new workload
  If you want to a new workload, you need:
  * Update the `workloads` array of config.json.
  * Provide a workload executor module, place it to `src/workloads/` directory.
  * Update the `executors` object of the function `genWorkloadsResults` in `src/run.js`.

  ## Note

  - This tool uses playwright v1.2.1, which is only guarantee to support Chromium >= 85.0.4182.0.
  - Tester should maintain the cpu_list.json file which is a CPU info lists used for finding matched CPU code name and corresponding competitor's test result.
  - Before testing, please restart the test device to make a clean up environment.
